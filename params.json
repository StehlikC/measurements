{"name":"Measurements","body":"# Measurements Ruby Gem\r\nThis gem was created to assist in converting cooking measurements when scaling up a recipe.\r\nI was having fun with it so I decided to go a little above and beyond.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This project ended up getting bigger than I had expected and now there are quite a few things that need fixing.\r\nI should have had a plan from the beginning...\r\n\r\n## Using the Gem\r\n\r\nInstall it with\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngem install measurements\r\n```\r\n\r\nand enjoy.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n```shell\r\nyardoc\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\nCreate an Ounce object with a quantity of 3oz\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nounce = Measurements.new_unit :ounce, 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nConvert that 3oz object to a Pound object\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npound = ounce.convert_to :pound\r\n```\r\n\r\nConvert the current unit by altering the unit itself\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nounce.convert_to! :pound\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate an Ounce object with a type of solid. This would be used to make sure when you convert\r\nusing the smart convert (not yet implemented) the unit doesn't get converted to a fluid measurement\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nounce = Measurements.new_unit :ounce, 3.5, :solid\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nGet the list of available units\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMeasurements.available_units\r\n=> [:ounce, :pound, :teaspoon, :tablespoon, :cup, :pint, :quart, :gallon, :inch, :foot, :yard, :furlong, :chain, :mile, :thou, :league]\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nGet the list of available types of units. ex: Solid, Fluid or Neutral\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMeasurements.available_types\r\n=> [:solid, :fluid, :neutral, :base] \r\n```\r\n\t\r\n## Getting Started with Development\r\nMake sure you have rubygems installed. You can find instructions at [rubygems.org](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3)\r\n\r\nHave bundler installed on your system\r\n\r\n\tgem install bundler\r\n\t\r\nRun bundler to make sure you have all the right gems\r\n\r\n\tbundle install\r\n\t\r\nGenerate some docs to browse while I work on getting some tests ready. After running the following command\r\nbrowse to the doc directory and open the index.html file in your favorite browser.\r\n\r\n\tyardoc\r\n\r\nRight now when I've been testing the gem inside irb I've been running the ruby line.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.dirname(__FILE__)+\"/lib\"); require 'measurements'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should also note that this only works if you launch irb from within the measurements directory.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be snazy and grab this line to load without using a text editor you can run one of these commands\r\n\r\n##### Unix\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncat README.md | grep \"LOAD_PATH\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Windows\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ntype README.md | find \"LOAD_PATH\"\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Casey Stehlik.","tagline":"A measurement gem for ruby.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
